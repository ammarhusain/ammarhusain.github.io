This contest has two major tasks that the robot must perform simultaneously.
For the first part the goal is to pick up an empty soda-can at the entrance to the course and then deposit the can directly under the pink sign 6 or less inches from the wall in the 'Recycle Area'.  The robot must find and pick up the can and then enter the course. In the course the robot must first find the center 'Stationary Light'. Above this light is an IR sensor that will detect the robot at that light. Once the robot trips that sensor, either the left or right 'Stationary Light' will turn on.  This indicates which 'Refuel Station' we need to visit.  The 'Refuel Stations' also has IR sensors above them.  Once the robot trips the correct 'Refuel Stations' sensor, the 'Recycle Area' sign will move.  This pink sign moves to a new random position each run.  The robot should find this sign and place the can directly underneath its center.   The can should be put as close to the pink sign as possible.

For the second task, the robot needs to find golf  balls of two different colors and move them to their respective chutes. The garbage chutes are circular areas near the entrance to the course.  Tape will be placed on the floor to indicate their positions.  The golf balls just need to be dropped off at the garbage chutes.  There will be 5 golf balls placed randomly inside the course. In order to confuse the robot, there will be a large orange box placed at a random location in the maze.

Through the course of the challenge the robot must continually communicate wirelessly, its position and environment information to a ground station. The robot completing the mission in the least amount of time wins the contest.

<p class=text>
Hybrid storage architecture is an efficient	method	that	can	optimize	I/O performance, cost and power consumption of storage systems. Currently data management is controlled by the users. The system users decide whether to place the data on the solid state disk or the hybrid hard disk manually.This paper presents an artificial intelligence mechanism that optimizes I/O performance based on the userâ€™s trace data. The mechanism is placed at the operating system level and possesses the ability to move files between the solid state disk and the hard disk drive. An artificial intelligence mechanism was created that utilized several parameters provided by the trace data to make decisions to reduce the access time for files that may be used in the future. Specifically temporal locality, process data correlation and process-process correlation were considered and an algorithm was designed to reduce access time keeping those parameters in mind.
