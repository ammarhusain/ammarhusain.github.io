<h2><font size="18" face="Calibri">AMMAR HUSAIN</font></h2>

Welcome! I am a Masters student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests lie broadly in robot perception and learning. Prior to this I was an undergraduate student in engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I have listed, on this website, the various projects that I have pursued during my time at CMU and UIUC. I was also fortunate to intern over various summers at General Electric and Merill Lynch.
